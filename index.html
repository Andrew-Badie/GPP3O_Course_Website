                <p>Hi! My name is Rita and I’m so excited for camp this year! I love to read, swim, play piano, paint, and I love food - my favourite by far is stuffed grape leaves. I also love trying new things and meeting new people! I can’t wait to meet everyone this year, and I’m looking forward to a summer filled with shared spiritual growth, getting to know everyone better, and many adventures!</p>

                <h3>DANIEL BOTROS</h3>
                <p>Hey camp! I'm so excited to be working as a counsellor this summer. SMSV has given me so much; serving in the camp is the least I can do to give back to our community. My favourite Bible verse is always changing, but right now it is John 8:51 (If anyone keeps my word, he shall never see death). For this year of camp, I'm most looking forward to the service trips where counsellors and campers will have the opportunity to genuinely act on what we claim to believe.</p>

        <h2>About the Program</h2>
        <p>Dive into the transformative journey of our all new Service & Leadership Team (SaLT) for our Grade 9 youth, the ultimate stepping stone between senior camper and future counsellor! Registration includes daily hot lunch & two snacks, field trips, service trips, leadership training, camp t-shirts, and much more!
        This unique intermediate stage allows SaLT participants to partake in the exhilarating senior camp field trips and the unforgettable go-away camp week. As SaLT members, these young leaders will also have the distinct honour of engaging in impactful volunteer opportunities during the Junior Camp, nurturing a sense of responsibility and leadership. This program is designed to enhance their leadership skills, build mentorship qualities, and deepen their connection with their peers.</p>
